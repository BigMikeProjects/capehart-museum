                        <p class="lead-text">For over twenty years, Don Capehart worked for Western Electric, the manufacturing arm of the Bell System. He watched as technology evolved, as electromechanical switches gave way to digital systems, as an era quietly ended.</p>

                        <p>Then came 1984. The court-ordered breakup of AT&T scattered a century of corporate history to the winds. Equipment that had connected millions of Americans was suddenly deemed obsolete, destined for the scrap heap.</p>

                        <blockquote class="pull-quote">
                            <p>"When Western Electric ceased operations, they were just throwing this stuff away. History—real, tangible history—going into dumpsters."</p>
                            <cite>Don Capehart</cite>
                        </blockquote>

                        <p>Don and Rita couldn't watch it happen. What started as rescuing a few pieces grew into an obsession, then a mission. They filled their home. They bought a warehouse—a former Coca-Cola bottling plant spanning 15,000 square feet. They kept saving.</p>

                        <p>By the time they were done, they had assembled what multiple publications called <em>the largest private telephone museum in the world</em>: over 8,000 artifacts spanning from the 1870s to the digital age.</p>

                        <p>In 2021, the collection went to auction. Pieces that had been rescued from dumpsters in 1984 scattered once again—this time to collectors, museums, and enthusiasts who recognized their value.</p>

                        <p>The building in Corsicana is quiet now. The switchboards will never light up again. The rotary dials will never click through their circuits.</p>

                            <p>Museums don't just preserve objects. They preserve the memory that objects once mattered—that someone cared enough to save them when everyone else had moved on.</p>
                        </blockquote>

                        <p>What the Capeharts built was never just a collection of old telephones. It was a testament to the human need to connect, to remember, to hold onto the tangible evidence of how we once lived.</p>

                        <p>The line goes silent. But the story remains.</p>

                        <p>Many of us grew up with rotary dials, busy signals, and party lines. These technologies shaped how families communicated, how teenagers found privacy, how businesses operated. The sounds and rituals of landline telephony are fading from living memory.</p>
                        <p>Take a moment to remember: the satisfying click of a rotary dial returning home. The weight of a Bakelite handset. The operator who knew your name in a small town.</p>
