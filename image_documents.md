## About the Capehart Communications Collection

The Capehart Communications Collection was a private museum in Corsicana, Texas, founded by Don and Rita Capehart in 1984. Don Capehart worked for Western Electric in Midland, Texas, and when the Bell System was broken up and equipment was being discarded, he began rescuing historically significant items.

The collection grew to occupy approximately 15,000 square feet in a former Coca-Cola bottling plant, containing an estimated 8,000 artifacts representing over a century of telecommunications history. The museum was open by appointment and offered personal tours.

The collection has since closed, and these photographs represent documentation of items that were once part of this remarkable private preservation effort.
